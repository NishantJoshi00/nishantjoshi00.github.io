            Everyone wants what they don't have. Some people ask for it, some people buy it, some people steal it and some people build it. Entropy is the natural order of things, and yet humans strive to create order out of chaos. By putting efforts we stand against the chaos and build things that last.

        If you see someone reading books with a skateboard in his hand, that's probably me. I specialize in walking around the city, or mountains or the beach. Some people might call me an adrenaline junkie, but I prefer the term. Give me a badminton racket, and you would think I am a professional. Probably not, but I can beat you in a game or two.

        I like discovering new cuisines and trying out new recipes. A cup of coffee with the right person, and I can talk about anything.
