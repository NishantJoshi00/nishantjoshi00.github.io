(Command Line Interface) Application are the programs that we run on our terminal or console. All the linux command we use are CLIs e.g. ls, cat, vim . The programs which uses flags and values to communicate with the inherent program.\ne.g.\n$ ls -l\n# This command displays all the files in the current directory in list format (-l : for list format)\n\nWhy C ?\nNow, why would you use C. For building such applications.\n\nC is fast as compared to other programming languages\nThe source code is obfuscated.\nC is better compatible with the kernel and runs seamlessly.\n\nImplementing CLI with C\nTaking Command Line Arguments\nIn C the command line arguments are taken in the main function as arguments. You might have seen the syntax used somewhere before and are wondering, why it is used\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {}\n// This could also be void main(int argc, char* argv[]) {}\n\n\nargc: This is the count of arguments provided to the program.\nargv: This is where the arguments are stored in form of character array\n\n\nThe minimum value of argc is always 1. Where the first argument is the actual name of the program that is been run. Thus the real arguments and flags start from index 1 for argv\n\neg.\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; example.c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nvoid main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n\tprintf(\"argc: %d, argv[0]: %s\\n\", argc, argv[0]);\n}\nEOF\ngcc example.c -o example\n./example\n# Output:\n# argc: 1, argv[0]: ./example\n\nNow, you could directly use this knowledge to biuld your command line application, but managing this flags and the value that are passed to the flags becomes difficult after a certain point, for this case C has functions that can be used.\nUsing getopt()\ngetopt() is a function from unistd.h. This function is used to parse single letter arguments which are followed by hyphen -.\neg.\n$ ls -la\n\t  ^^\n\t  |\\-- # Here `a` is a flag\n\t  \\--- # Here `l` is a flag\n\nHow to implement it\nWe will take a program for example and then understand how it works\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    extern char *optarg;\n    extern int optind;\n    int out, err = 0;\n    int lflag = 0, fflag = 0;\n    char *fname;\n    static char usage[] = \"usage: %s [-l] -f fname name\\n\";\n\n    while ((out = getopt(argc, argv, \"lf:\")) != -1) {\n        switch (out) {\n            case 'l':\n                lflag = 1;\n                break;\n            case 'f':\n                fflag = 1;\n                fname = optarg;\n                break;\n            case '?':\n                err = 1;\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (fflag == 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"%s: missing -f option\\n\", argv[0]);\n        exit(1);\n    } else if ((optind + 1) != argc) {\n        if (optind == argc) fprintf(stderr, \"%s: missing name\\n\", argv[0]);\n        else fprintf(stderr, \"%s: more that one name provided\\n\", argv[0]);\n        fprintf(stderr, usage, argv[0]);\n        exit(1);\n    } else if (err) {\n        fprintf(stderr, usage, argv[0]);\n        exit(1);\n    }\n    if (lflag) printf(\"-l was used\\n\");\n    printf(\"%s was provided for -f\\n\", fname);\n    printf(\"name : %s\\n\", argv[optind]);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAbove is is a simple example which has a usage line similar to:\nusage: ./example [-l] -f fname name\nWhere -l is an optional flag, where as -f is compulsary.\nNow, lets understand the code:\nUndestanding the code\n\n\nThe includes are done for the following reasons:\n\nstdio.h: I/O functionality like printf, fprintf, etc\nstdlib.h: standard C library for exit function, exit status codes, etc\nunistd.h: This has the implementation of getopt()\n\n\n\nThe main function has the command line arguments passed to it, as explained in the previous title.\n\n\nVariables defined are as follows:\n\n\nextern char *optarg: This is for storing the values that are passed to a flag. Here for -f flag. Where this flag is recieved the variable points to the string that was passed to it.\n\n\nextern int optind: This is the index of the argument that is being parsed.\n\n\nint out, err =0: The out is for storing the current argument that is being parsed of -1 if EOArgument is reached. err is to check if any invaid flag is passed. it is used in the end of the switch statement.\n\n\nint lflag = 0, fflag = 0: This variables are for knowning if the flags were triggered. Here, in my case -l or -f are triggered or not. char *fname similarly this is for storing the argument passed to the -f flag.\n\n\nThe usage string is just for providing with a useful help if they want to know which flags are to be used and how, if any special cases. There is a syntax to write this as well, the flags present in the [] (squarebrackets) are representing the optional flags and the others show the compulsary flags or arguments\n\n\n\n\nIn the while loop, is where the magic happens\nout = getopt(argc, argv, \"lf:\")\n\n​ Here the arguments that are passed to the main function are directly passed to the getopt function, with an extra argument. This extra argument is the schema for parsing the flags.\n​ Here, \"lf:\" means look for -l flag and look for -f flag with an argument :.\n​ eg. abe:w: here -a and -b are the flags (toggles) and -e and -w would expect an argument.\nThere is no special way to tell if a argument is permanent of optional this can be checked after the while loop manually, well this is C after all 😅.\n​ Every time the variable out will hold the flag. and if it equals -1 then there are no further flags to parse.\n\n\nThe switch case, this is where you parse the flags.\n​ As stated in the top out holds the flag name. Thus we are checking if the flag that is present is one of the desired one, if so the we say that the flag is triggered by setting the variable corresponding to the flag to 1 i.e. true (Ain’t no boolean in C).\n\n\noptarg: The variable stores the string (char *) that is passed to the flags with : in front of them, in the schema in the point above.\n\n\ncase '?': Now, we haven’t added ? to the schema, then why are we looking for it.\n​ This cases tests if any flag other than those specified in the schema are passed. That’s why we are setting err = 1. We will use this variable to raise an exception in the future.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we do the error handling\n\n\nWe first look if the -f was triggered or not. if not triggered then we print the error message to the STDERR and then exit with a status code of 1.\n\n\nThe second condition is used to check if the all the arguments are parsed.\nwe are comparing the optind and argc.\noptind points to the current argument that is being parsed. If it points to the unnamed variable if any left or it’s value would be equal to that of argc. This would mean that all the variables are parsed and no unnamed variable are left.\n\n\nWe also look for the err variable which is triggered if any unnamed flag is invoked.\n\n\n\n\nWe are finally going for the implementation.\nAt the end you can use the flags that are invoked how ever you want. Here i am just printing if the flag is invoked. But you can get creative.\n\n\nFuture of CLI\nWe were talking about C, but there are other languages with implement the command line interface much better that getopt. There are also other command line implementation in C, if you dig through the internet. But this is the default methods that are provided but the standard library (unstd.h).\n","id":"https://nishantjoshi00.github.io/blog/college/building-clis-with-c/","title":"Building CLIs with C"},"https://nishantjoshi00.github.io/blog/college/disk-encryption/":{"body":"Disk Encryption\nGiven below is a method of encrypting your hard-drive partition (SSD/HDD) using luks encryption method, But this file system can only be recognised in a Linux Box and thus can only be decrypted in Linux.

Each language has its own nuances, character set, grammar, and unique expression. But at the end of the day, all these languages share a singular purpose: to provide a means of communicating our thoughts and navigating the complexities of a system we call society.\nTo provide us with a way to convey our thoughts, and to solve a very complex problem we call communication, in a very complex system we call society. Computers aren’t very different in that regard. Though there might be a variety of programming languages out there, at the heart of it, they are all aimed at solving problems.\nThey could be:\n\nprocessualis (Procedural)\nकार्यात्मक (Functional)\nபொருள் நோக்கிய (Object Oriented)\n\n\nBut, at the end of the day, I’m pretty sure you could do 1 + 1 in all of them. Or, better yet, write a multi-user concurrent transaction handling system. Then, why are people chasing new languages (like Rust) and talking about how JavaScript is “the next best thing since sliced bread”?\nBut on a serious note, the real advantage of learning new languages isn’t just to solve these real-world problems, but to gain a different perspective to think, a different understanding of the moving parts involved, and finally, an innate appreciation towards the problems themselves. “Everything you write will eventually turn to 0s and 1s”; that’s true, but the way you express it will not just run on your computers, but also on the minds of the people who see it.\nI set out on a journey, an adventure: The Adventure of Code. But I didn’t want it to be like all the general coding challenges out there. So, to spice things up, I planned on using different languages per problem, and to top that I set a self-imposed condition that I will only use the languages that I don’t already know!\n\n\nTalk is cheap. Show me the code. Here you go github:advent-of-code-2023!\n\n\nThe first thought on my mind as any programmer would have had was, “I want to code Assembly!”, and so I did!\n\nImperative Programming\nHow bad can it be to try and solve a complete problem in what I would call a purely Imperative Language? And believe me, it was hard. After finding a handful of instructions that would help me solve the problem and 4 hours of head-scratching and giving up a couple of times, I was finally able to solve the first part of the problem. But guess what? There was a second part to the problem that required me to do a string lookup. My frustrated soul couldn’t handle implementing a hashmap for this, so I did the most imperative thing possible, and though ugly, it worked.\ncheck_numbers:\n  call check_0\n  call check_1\n  call check_2\n  call check_3\n  call check_4\n  call check_5\n  call check_6\n  call check_7\n  call check_8\n  call check_9\n  ret\n\n\n\nRule #1: Good code is code that works.\n\n\nBy the time I had completed admiring the horrific beauty of my code, the next imperative language was COBOL. I thought COBOL would be easy, and looking back, it probably was. The whole code looked more or less like an essay, and of all the languages that I used, this had the most English in it. My guess is, it was used for documentation or offloading work to interns.\n\n\nRule #2: A good code should be easier to read, regardless of the technical background.\n\n\nWhile traveling the imperative path, there were a few languages that threw me for a loop (literally in Zig’s case). One of them was Zig. Maybe it was just me, but working with a language where any allocation had to be hand-wrung from an allocator object felt like walking a memory tightrope. And the worst of it all? I couldn’t even build a bridge of coupled recursion with two fallible functions – Zig wouldn’t let me! This was completely unexpected, like facing a “no recursion allowed” sign after years of coding freedom. No other language had ever tried to clip my recursion wings – except maybe Rust, but that’s a story for another day. The second language that really threw me off was R. I’ve never been more frustrated than when wrestling with R’s array constructions and concatenation. Maybe it’s just me, but the way everything fit together felt like trying to solve a Rubik’s cube blindfolded – it was frustrating…\n\n\nRule #3: variable names are very important; we don’t accept either c or PerformArrayConcatWithVaryingDims, both are equally bad.\n\n\nThere were a lot of good programming languages along the way: Lua and ruby with their simplicity and relatability to preconceived notions of programming languages; Fortran and Go with their inherently supported concurrency and robust design; and the free-flowing syntax and maturity of Python and Julia. And then there was CoffeeScript… me trying to curse it would be an insult to the curse words themselves.\n\n\nRule #4: The freedom of telling the computer exactly what to do, has its downsides. (it’s like teaching a child, how to bake a cake). There are 3 outcomes (We get the cake, the house explodes, the child dies)\n\n\nAs my imperative path reached its end, a new challenge awaited—it was finally time to cross the mountains of…\n\nObject-Oriented Programming\nJava was out of the question, that much was certain. I wanted to start pure. But was I truly ready? The challenge loomed before me, a daunting prospect for any introvert—SmallTalk. Or at least, so I thought until I realized it was just a programming language. A purely object-oriented programming language, to be precise.\nDuring my research, the concept of a language composed entirely of objects boggled my mind. Then, as I delved into the programming itself, confusion mingled with intrigue as I grappled with the unorthodox dataflow (this sentence literally represents my thoughts from back then). Yet, I was somehow excited. This was unlike anything I’d encountered before. Imagine a language where even conditional statements operate through messages passed between objects like corrupt politicians slipping bribes under the table to get things done.\n\n\nRule #5: Having functions doesn’t mean everything has to be functional.\n\n\nAs I scaled the steep mountains of object-oriented programming, I stumbled upon something I’d always dismissed as extremely ancient, weird, and unlikely to cross my path: PHP! I’d always envisioned PHP as a relic from the past, a realm of difficulty, gooiness, and utter chaos. But reality proved vastly different. The first PHP code I ever wrote turned out to be remarkably clear, concise, and fully embraced the power of OOP. It was an experience worth remembering, a testament to the age-old wisdom of “not judging a book by its cover.”\nIt might also be the preconceived notion that PHP has a bad language design and will always stay that way. Moreover, it also felt that the language has evolved to be more robust and easy to adapt to. To put it simply, I didn’t feel like I was learning a new language, but just using the built-up experience.\n\n\nRule #6: Let’s try to package data, with all the constituent information contained within them.\n\n\nI’d planned to write some Java, but I knew the next best thing—and the final Object-Oriented Obstacle—Scala. And for all the people out there screaming that it’s a functional programming language, I have news for you: the first word I wrote when I started coding wasn’t fn, fun, or def. It was object!\nScala presented an interesting language transition. With my experience in Rust, Java, and Python at work, I thought it would be a cinch. But I’m not exactly proud of the code I produced. Still, compared to a few other languages where I’d had to implement preliminary functionality, Scala felt quite comfortable.\n\n\nRule #7: Awry commented code is worse than bad code. (It’s similar to gossip, it poisons the mind of both the writer and the reader).\n\n\nHere we are, folks—the final path in this grand journey. It’s time to dive into the river of…\n\nFunctional Programming\nAnd what better way to start than pure? It’s time to pull out the big guns: Haskell. I’d envisioned writing my dream functional code, but dreams are just dreams. I ended up with a Dijkstra algorithm sporting some of the ugliest functions I’ve ever crafted in any functional language. It was more like functional vomit. But hey, that vomit functions.\n\n\nRule #8: Let’s face it, “with great power comes great responsibility”.\n\n\nBut to a larger extent, these languages were very well-built, and I was finally getting some much-needed help from my editor. In nearly all of the previous languages, either there wasn’t an LSP or it was quite time-consuming to set one up. In this challenge, out of all the functional programming languages I used, I found Ocaml to be truly exceptional at fulfilling its purpose.\n\n\nBeing Functional\n\nSolve My Problems\n\nMaximize Reusability\n\n\nAnd before you start saying every language is reusable, sure, “If you can read assembly, everything is open source,” but who has time for that? I crave languages that embrace reusability from the start. OCaml delivered in a big way. Don’t believe me? Witness the magic…\n\n\n  \n    Was able to solve day-9 part-2 of advent of code with just one-line change\n    to part-1. (in OCaml)Functional programming definitely has its\n    perks!!If you are curious you can check the code out here.https://t.co/4ItEdCRS7q#ocaml\n    #functional\n    #programming\n    pic.twitter.com/DLKAgPD6Gn\n  \n  — Nishant Joshi (@nishantjosh)\n  December 17, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule #9: Code should improve re-usability and facilitate easy refactoring for future code modifications.\n\n\nAfter wrestling with both Erlang and OCaml, Elixir felt like their love child, inheriting function definitions from Erlang and operators from OCaml.\nMy journey stretched across countless languages, but these were some of the most captivating detours. While this is just a sliver of the learning I gleaned, it was worth every hurdle and relentless DuckDuckGo-ing session. In the end, the true hero of this odyssey wasn’t the procedural forest, the object-oriented mountains, or the functional river, but Markdown! It’s the narrator, unlike the nanosecond warriors – markdown’s the language this very blog breathes in.\n\nRule #10: no code, is good code.\n\n\nThis was the journey, or at least a glimpse of it, littered with countless obstacles and daunting challenges. Yet, at the end, the sweetness of satisfaction and the fruit of unwavering determination were beyond compare. The real challenge wasn’t solving all those problems; but rather, being consistent and not giving up on the principles that I set for myself. (Well! I did solve the last problem in Python, but in my defense, finding eigenvectors for Laplacian matrix would’ve been hella difficult in BrainFuck.)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in scrutinizing my code, or wish to talk smack about it.
