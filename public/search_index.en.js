The programs which uses flags and values to communicate with the inherent program.\ne.g.\n$ ls -l\n# This command displays all the files in the current directory in list format (-l : for list format)\n\nWhy C ?\nNow, why would you use C. For building such applications.\n\nC is fast as compared to other programming languages\nThe source code is obfuscated.\nC is better compatible with the kernel and runs seamlessly.\n\nImplementing CLI with C\nTaking Command Line Arguments\nIn C the command line arguments are taken in the main function as arguments. You might have seen the syntax used somewhere before and are wondering, why it is used\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {}\n// This could also be void main(int argc, char* argv[]) {}\n\n\nargc: This is the count of arguments provided to the program.\nargv: This is where the arguments are stored in form of character array\n\n\nThe minimum value of argc is always 1. Where the first argument is the actual name of the program that is been run. Thus the real arguments and flags start from index 1 for argv\n\neg.\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; example.c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nvoid main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n\tprintf(\"argc: %d, argv[0]: %s\\n\", argc, argv[0]);\n}\nEOF\ngcc example.c -o example\n./example\n# Output:\n# argc: 1, argv[0]: ./example\n\nNow, you could directly use this knowledge to biuld your command line application, but managing this flags and the value that are passed to the flags becomes difficult after a certain point, for this case C has functions that can be used.\nUsing getopt()\ngetopt() is a function from unistd.h. This function is used to parse single letter arguments which are followed by hyphen -.\neg.\n$ ls -la\n\t  ^^\n\t  |\\-- # Here `a` is a flag\n\t  \\--- # Here `l` is a flag\n\nHow to implement it\nWe will take a program for example and then understand how it works\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    extern char *optarg;\n    extern int optind;\n    int out, err = 0;\n    int lflag = 0, fflag = 0;\n    char *fname;\n    static char usage[] = \"usage: %s [-l] -f fname name\\n\";\n\n    while ((out = getopt(argc, argv, \"lf:\")) != -1) {\n        switch (out) {\n            case 'l':\n                lflag = 1;\n                break;\n            case 'f':\n                fflag = 1;\n                fname = optarg;\n                break;\n            case '?':\n                err = 1;\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (fflag == 0) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"%s: missing -f option\\n\", argv[0]);\n        exit(1);\n    } else if ((optind + 1) != argc) {\n        if (optind == argc) fprintf(stderr, \"%s: missing name\\n\", argv[0]);\n        else fprintf(stderr, \"%s: more that one name provided\\n\", argv[0]);\n        fprintf(stderr, usage, argv[0]);\n        exit(1);\n    } else if (err) {\n        fprintf(stderr, usage, argv[0]);\n        exit(1);\n    }\n    if (lflag) printf(\"-l was used\\n\");\n    printf(\"%s was provided for -f\\n\", fname);\n    printf(\"name : %s\\n\", argv[optind]);\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAbove is is a simple example which has a usage line similar to:\nusage: ./example [-l] -f fname name\nWhere -l is an optional flag, where as -f is compulsary.\nNow, lets understand the code:\nUndestanding the code\n\n\nThe includes are done for the following reasons:\n\nstdio.h: I/O functionality like printf, fprintf, etc\nstdlib.h: standard C library for exit function, exit status codes, etc\nunistd.h: This has the implementation of getopt()\n\n\n\nThe main function has the command line arguments passed to it, as explained in the previous title.\n\n\nVariables defined are as follows:\n\n\nextern char *optarg: This is for storing the values that are passed to a flag. Here for -f flag. Where this flag is recieved the variable points to the string that was passed to it.\n\n\nextern int optind: This is the index of the argument that is being parsed.\n\n\nint out, err =0: The out is for storing the current argument that is being parsed of -1 if EOArgument is reached. err is to check if any invaid flag is passed. it is used in the end of the switch statement.\n\n\nint lflag = 0, fflag = 0: This variables are for knowning if the flags were triggered. Here, in my case -l or -f are triggered or not. char *fname similarly this is for storing the argument passed to the -f flag.\n\n\nThe usage string is just for providing with a useful help if they want to know which flags are to be used and how, if any special cases. There is a syntax to write this as well, the flags present in the [] (squarebrackets) are representing the optional flags and the others show the compulsary flags or arguments\n\n\n\n\nIn the while loop, is where the magic happens\nout = getopt(argc, argv, \"lf:\")\n\n​ Here the arguments that are passed to the main function are directly passed to the getopt function, with an extra argument. This extra argument is the schema for parsing the flags.\n​ Here, \"lf:\" means look for -l flag and look for -f flag with an argument :.\n​ eg. abe:w: here -a and -b are the flags (toggles) and -e and -w would expect an argument.\nThere is no special way to tell if a argument is permanent of optional this can be checked after the while loop manually, well this is C after all 😅.\n​ Every time the variable out will hold the flag. and if it equals -1 then there are no further flags to parse.\n\n\nThe switch case, this is where you parse the flags.\n​ As stated in the top out holds the flag name. Thus we are checking if the flag that is present is one of the desired one, if so the we say that the flag is triggered by setting the variable corresponding to the flag to 1 i.e. true (Ain’t no boolean in C).\n\n\noptarg: The variable stores the string (char *) that is passed to the flags with : in front of them, in the schema in the point above.\n\n\ncase '?': Now, we haven’t added ? to the schema, then why are we looking for it.\n​ This cases tests if any flag other than those specified in the schema are passed. That’s why we are setting err = 1. We will use this variable to raise an exception in the future.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we do the error handling\n\n\nWe first look if the -f was triggered or not. if not triggered then we print the error message to the STDERR and then exit with a status code of 1.\n\n\nThe second condition is used to check if the all the arguments are parsed.\nwe are comparing the optind and argc.\noptind points to the current argument that is being parsed. If it points to the unnamed variable if any left or it’s value would be equal to that of argc. This would mean that all the variables are parsed and no unnamed variable are left.\n\n\nWe also look for the err variable which is triggered if any unnamed flag is invoked.\n\n\n\n\nWe are finally going for the implementation.\nAt the end you can use the flags that are invoked how ever you want. Here i am just printing if the flag is invoked. But you can get creative.\n\n\nFuture of CLI\nWe were talking about C, but there are other languages with implement the command line interface much better that getopt. There are also other command line implementation in C, if you dig through the internet. But this is the default methods that are provided but the standard library (unstd.h).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/building-clis-with-c/","title":"Building CLIs with C"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/disk-encryption/":{"body":"Disk Encryption\nGiven below is a method of encrypting your hard-drive partition (SSD/HDD) using luks encryption method, But this file system can only be recognised in a Linux Box and thus can only be decrypted in Linux. As the partition format is unrecognized in windows filesystem.\nFormatting the Partition\n\nHere we are formatting the partition in LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)\n\nHere we use luksFormat to create a encryption layer. On the partition. By doing so the partition will be completed formated so make sure it is a empty partition.\n$ cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdxY\n\nHere x is a alphabet, and Y is a number, which reperesent the block file for the Yth partition of disk x.\n\nInitialise LUKS devices\nHere we use the luksOpen which temporarily disables the encryption layer.\nThis devices will then be available in /dev/mapper/\nhere  is a arbitrary value used to identify the block file.\n$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdxY &lt;name&gt;\n\n\nFormat this decrypted device\nAs luks acts as an encrypted wrapper over the underlying partition. we can use any mkfs cmd to format it. We can then normally mount it. This is done only after unlocking the encryption layer.\n\nMounting the Device\n\nSometimes connecting the device with a encrypted partition, automatically provokes a initialising and mounting procedure and prompts you to enter your password, in some Linux operating systems.\n\nThe device can be mounted simply using the mount command\n$ mount /dev/mapper/&lt;name&gt; &lt;mountpoint&gt;\n\n\nRe-Encrypt the partition\nHere the drive must be unmounted first, then perform a re-encryption using:\n$ cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/&lt;name&gt;\n\nChanging the Password of the partition\nThis requires you to know the old password given to the partition.\n$ cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/sdxY\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/disk-encryption/","title":"Disk encryption using LUKS"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/handling-secure-boot/":{"body":"Handling Secure Boot\nWhat is Secure Boot?\nSecure boot is a feature provided by many manufacturing companies, this feature is present inside the BIOS of your system. The prime goal of this feature is to check whether the bootloader that is being executed is safe (Key verified) of not.\nWhy do self-signing?\nSelf-signing allows the user the sign manually which bootloaders are allowed to be executed, or to sign some binaries that you have created and you want to execute at boot time. It uses the MOK manager to adds the key as trusted signing agent. \nHow to Self-sign\n\n\nCreating your own key, certificate to add\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.key -out MOK.crt \\\n\t-nodes -days 3650 -subj \"/CN: &lt;Your Name&gt;/\"\n$ openssl x509 -in MOK.crt -out MOK.cer\n# &lt;Your Name&gt; : Enter your name\n\nNow there would be three files in the current folder MOK.key, MOK.crt, MOK.cer\n\nHere the MOK.key is very important and should be kept safe.\n\n\n\nImporting the certificate into the MOK manager\n$ sudo mokutil --import MOK.cer\n# Here you would be prompted for a input password.\n# This password has further uses so do not forget it\n\n\n\nHere after, it depends on what you want to sign\n\nSigning Binaries\nThis is a low risk easy to perform task, go to the directory where the binaries are stored\nsbsign --key /path/to/MOK.key --cert /path/to/MOK.crt\\ --output &lt;ofilename&gt;.efi &lt;filename&gt;.efi\n# Here the ofilename can be same as filename\n# filename is the file you want to sign\n\n\nSigning Kernel modules\nIn alternative to signing binaries some times kernel modules can also cause the secure boot check to fail. Signing the kernel modules is as simple as signing any other binary.\n$ kmodsign sha512 MOK.key MOK.cer module.ko module.ko\n# here we are signing the module.ko using the MOK.key\n\n\nAlternatives to self-signing\nNow, you must be wondering, are there any other alternatives to self signing, definitly!. But for thing alternatives you lose the freedom that is granted to you by the self-signing technique. The alternatives are \n\nshim\nPreLoader\n\nThere are other methods but shim it the one used in ubuntu to make it possible to boot into ubuntu even if the secure boot in on. i.e. because the ubuntu bootloader is signed by microsoft which grants to access to boot into the computer.\n\nResources\nPlease Do read this amazing blog post on\n: how-to-sign-things-for-secure-boot\n\nDone !!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/handling-secure-boot/","title":"Handling Secure Boot"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/using-tor-on-command-line-for-debian/":{"body":"Introduction\nWhat is Tor ??\nTor is a network that is used to provide higher security that any existing VPN by enveloping your data into multiple security layers which renders the source untrackable.\n\nUnless you share your location to the website you wish to visit or Google\n\nWhy from Command Line ??\nBasically because it is fun, but also most of the work you would do, ends up done on the terminal in linux, like i have a habit of opening firefox using\n$ firefox &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp; instead of clicking on the icon.

Each language has it’s nuonces; each has it’s own character set, each one has it’s own grammar and each own is unique in how it is written/spoken. But at the end of the day, all these languages have a single purpose.\nTo provide us with a way to convay our thoughts, and to solve a very complex problem we called communication, in a very complex system we call society.\nComputers aren’t very different in that regard. Though, there might be a multitude of programming languages out there at the heart of it, they are all aimed to solve problems.\nThey could be:\n\nprocessualis (Procedural)\nकार्यात्मक (Functional)\nபொருள் நோக்கிய (Object Oriented)\n\nBut, at the end of the day, I am pretty sure you could do 1 + 1 in all of them. Or better yet, write a multi-user concurrent transaction handling system. Then, why do people make such a fuss around which language to learn and how JavaScript is “The next best thing since sliced bread”.\nBut on a serious note, the real advantage of learning new languages, isn’t just for solve these real world problems, but a different perspective to think, a different understanding of the moving parts involved and finally a innate appreciation towards the problems itself. “Everything you write will eventually turn to 0s and 1s”, that’s true, but the way you express it will not just run on your computers but also on the minds of the people who see it.\nIn my search to find this innate appreciation for problems, I set out on a journey, an advanture. The advanture of code. But, I didn’t what is to be like all the general coding challenges out there. So, to spice things up, I planned on using different languages per problem. Don’t worry, this isn’t a write-up on how I solved the problems and don’t work I won’t give you any spoilers about them. This is my perspective how each of the languages that I used and the understanding I gained at the end of each day.\nPS. Dear Internet, I would appreciate if you critique my implementations, but remember I am not claiminig that I have learnt all the languages, nor am I saying that all the implementations are perfect and can run so fast that they would travel back in time and alter reality. If that was the case, all my code would have magically become better.\n\nThe first thought on my mind as any programmer would have had was, “I want to code Assembly!”, and so I did!\nImperative Programming\nHow bad can it be to try and solve a complete problem in what I would call a purely Imperative Language. And believe me, it was hard, after finding a handful of insturtions that will help me solve the problem and 4 hours of head scratching and giving up a couple of times, I was finally able to solve the first part of the problem. But, guess what there was a second part to the problem and which required me to do string lookup, for frustrated soul couldn’t handle implementing a hashmap for this, so I did the must imperative thing possible, and though ugly it worked.\ncheck_numbers:\n  call check_0\n  call check_1\n  call check_2\n  call check_3\n  call check_4\n  call check_5\n  call check_6\n  call check_7\n  call check_8\n  call check_9\n  ret\n\n\nRule #1: A good code is a code that works.\n\nBy the time, I had completed admiring the horrific beauty of my code, the next imperative language COBOL. I thought COBOL would be easy, and looking back at it, it probably was. The whole code, looked more or less like an essay, and of all the languages that I used, this had the most english in it. My guess is, it was used to document and give tasks to interns, before computers took their jobs.\n\nRule #2: A good code should be easier to read, regardless of the technical background.\n\nWhile traveling the imperative path, there were a few languages that gave me a hard time, one of them was Zig, maybe it was just me, but working with a language where, any allocation that I need to do, needs to be done via a allocator object, and the worst of all, I wan’t able to implement coupled recursion with 2 fallible functions. This was foreign to me, as no language has every asked me not to do recursion, except Rust, but that’s a story for another day. The second language, that arrayed me out was R, I was more frustrated, coding in R then I was in any of the other languages, maybe its just me, but the way array constructions and concatenation worked, mangled my brain.\n\nRule #3: variable names are very important; we don’t accept either c or PerformArrayConcatenationWhichMightAlsoHelpInChangingArrayDimensions, both are equally bad.\n\nThere were a lot of good programming languages along the way, lua, ruby with their simplicity and relatibility to perconcieved notion of programming languages, Fortran, Go with their inherently supported concurrency and robust design, the free flowing syntax and maturity of Python, Julia; and then there was CoffeeScript, me trying to curse this would be an insult to the curse words.\n\nRule #4: The freedom of telling the computer exactly what to do, has it’s downsides. (it’s like teaching a child, how to bake a cake). There are 3 outcomes (We get the cake, the house explodes, the child dies)\n\nAs my imperative path reached its end, a new challenged was ready and waiting, it was finally time to cross the mountains of\nObject Oriented Programming\nAnd well, I wasn’t going to use Java, that was certain. So, why not start pure. But, I wasn’t ready, the challenge sounded so grave, Me just like all my fellow introverted readers was faced with the challenge of a life time, SmallTalk. Or atleast so I thought, until in realized its just a programming language; a purly object oriented programming language. While researching on the language, I was baffled by the thought that there could be a programming language, that could just comprise of objects. While programming, I felt a but confounded and intrigued by the dataflow and at the same time excited about how it was different that what I was used to. Imagine a language where even the conditional statements work, as If you are passing messages between objects similar to how corrupt politicians pass money under the table to execute certain things on conditions.\n\nRule #5: Having functions doesn’t mean everything has to be a functional.\n\nAs I was scaling the steep mountains of object oriented programming, I stepped upon something I used to call out to be, extremely ancient, weird and possibly something that I will never stumble upon, PHP! I always though PHP was this ancient relic from the past in which everything was difficult, gooey and a complete mess. But, turned out to be very different, I would say the first every PHP code that I have every written turned out to be extremely clear, consise and leveraging the complete power of OOP. It was definitely a exprerience worth remembering and it just gave me a proof that, “I should not judge a book, by their cover”.\n\nRule #6: Let’s try to package data, with all the constituent information contained within them.\n\nI was planning to write some Java, but I knew the next best thing, and the final Object Oriented Obstacle Scala. And for all the people screaming that it’s a functional programming language, no! the first word that I actually wrote when I started writing the code wasn’t fn, fun or def. Guess what, it was object! Scala was an interesting language transaction, with my exprerience on Rust, Java, Python, in my workplace, I thought it would be a sinch, but I am not very proud of the code that actually came out. But, compared to a few other languages where I had to implement preliminary functionality, this was quiet a comfortable language.\n\nRule #7: Commented code, is worst than bad code. (It’s similar to gossip, it poisons the mind of both the writer and the reader).\n\nHere we are folks, the final path in this great journey, and it’s time to get wet in the river of\nFunctional Programming\nAnd what better way then to start pure, it was time to pull out the big guns, Haskell. I was planning to write my dream functional code, but dream are just dreams. I ended up writing dijkstra algorithm, with some of the most ugly looking functions that I have every writtne in any of the functional languages I know. It was more like functional vomit. But, nonetheless, that vomit functions.\n\nRule #8: Let’s face it, “with more power comes more responsibility”.\n\nBut, to a larger extent these languages were very well built, and I was finally getting some help from my editor, otherwise in nearly all of the previous languages, either there wasn’t a LSP or it was quite time consuming to set it up. In the challenge out of all the functional programming languages I used, I found Ocaml to be really great at doing what it is supposed to do.\n\n\nBeing Functional\n\nSolve My Problems\n\nMaximize Reusibility\n\nAnd before you start saying every language, is reusable. I would like to say, “If you can read assembly, everything is open source.”. Here, checkout this tweet, about how easy it was for me to build open my earlier solution to solve the part-2.\n\n\n  \n    Was able to solve day-9 part-2 of advent of code with just one-line change\n    to part-1. (in OCaml)Functional programming definitely has its\n    perks!!If you are curious you can check the code out here.https://t.co/4ItEdCRS7q#ocaml\n    #functional\n    #programming\n    pic.twitter.com/DLKAgPD6Gn\n  \n  — Nishant Joshi (@nishantjosh)\n  December 17, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nRule #9: Code should improves re-usability and facilitate easy refactoring for future code modifications.\n\nAfter writing both, Erlang and OCaml, it felt like Elixir was their elicit baby. with function definitions like erlang has and operators similar to that of OCaml.\nThough, there were many more languages that were part of the stretched out journey, these were some of the more interesting one’s. And though, this is just a fraction of the learning that I found during this challenge, it was worth ever hardship and relentless duckduckgoing, that I did. But, the real hero of this journey isn’t the forest of procedural programming, the mountains of object oriented programming or the river of functional programming, it is and always will be Markdown! Because, its the narrator who gets to tell the story not the warriers who can fight nanosecond wars, its the language that the blog is written in.\n\nRule #10: no code, is good code.\n\nThis was the journey, or atleast the glimpse of it, countless obstacles and numerous challenges and at the end of it all, the feeling of satisfactions and the fruit of determination was ever so sweet. The real challenge wasn’t in solve all those problems, it was in following though with the chllenge relentlessly, without losing heart.\nIf you are atleast interested in looking over the code, scrutinising it, or just bitching about it.

But remember what Kakashi said, “In society, those who don’t have many ablities tend to complain more.”\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lingual-odyssey/","title":"The Lingual Odyssey"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":3,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":6,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/":{"body":2,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/building-clis-with-c/":{"body":673,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/disk-encryption/":{"body":164,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/handling-secure-boot/":{"body":230,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/using-tor-on-command-line-for-debian/":{"body":258,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/college/wireguard/":{"body":379,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/lingual-odyssey/":{"body":980,"title":2}},"length":9},"lang":"English"};
